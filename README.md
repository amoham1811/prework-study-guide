# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is provided as a brief guide for students who are completely new to front end development and are attempting to work through the pre course materials a preparation for the Front End Bootcamp. The guide is divided into four sections: Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS), Global Information Tracker (GIT) and JavaScript. Each section briefly introduce either some common commands as in the case of GIT or some basic concepts such as JavaScript.

I am familiar with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. However, this exercise has given be a good insight into use of git which I have been meaning to use for quite sometime. The prework is designed to provide a taster for each of the four sections but the exercises are well structured and deep enough for the student to feel confident about their learning.


## Installation

## Usage

In addition to providing information about the four topics, the webpage also offers an oppotunity to see JavaScript through the webpage debugging tool. The tool can be invoked from the webpage by right-clicking the mouse and selecting inspect from the pop up menu (last item).

If you navigate to the console tap you can see the output of the JavaScript code which displays the names of the four areas covered by this guide as well as which topic to start with.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
